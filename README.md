## Credits
Programmer / Designer - **Jeffrey M Johnson**

## What
Creates a sprite sheet that converts separate images into a single image. An atlas 
file (description of the location of each image on the sheet in xml form) is also 
created when the sprite sheet is saved.

## How
#### Tools / Libraries
* C#
* WPF / XAML

#### Interesting Code
* [SpriteSheet Class](https://github.com/JeffreyMJohnson/AtlasEngine/blob/master/AtlasEngine/SpriteSheet.cs)
* [AtlasDocument Class](https://github.com/JeffreyMJohnson/AtlasEngine/blob/master/AtlasEngine/AtlasDocument.cs)
* [MainWindow Class](https://github.com/JeffreyMJohnson/AtlasEngine/blob/master/AtlasEngine/MainWindow.xaml.cs)

## Current Status
Project is stale. If I thought anyone would need it I would take another look, but 
there are a lot of good tools freely available now. fun project though, and learned 
a lot.

## To-Do
* Maybe a how-to tutorial of some sort could be derived from this project.
